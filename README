Remote Deskop Session Disconnect
=================================

This tool will find all the remote desktop connection sessions on the server.
and give you a list, where you can "kill" the sessions using the ID provided in the list.

I have testet this on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008R2. and it even works from a windows 7 client to access the server - Keep in mind this requires Admin or Domain administrator Priviliges.

I made this tool because i was working for a company who had a lot of problems with the windows servere. As default you'll only get license to open 2 "remote desktop connections" at the same time. And because the users clients always would crash or go to sleepmode the session was "disconnected" but not closed, and that counted as a session.


The tool is written in batch (bat) So everyone who know DOS pretty much should be able to modyfi it if needed.
