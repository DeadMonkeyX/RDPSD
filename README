Remote Deskop Session Disconnect

I made this tool for a while ago because i was working for a company who had problems with remote desktop sessions that dident get disconnected because of client crash and computers going to sleepmode.

I can simply find all the remote desktop connection sessions on the server, and give you a list with then. form there you can kill them using the ID number.

This tool has been testet on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008R2 and even using it on a Windows 7 client to "access" the servers sessions however that requires the win7 machine is in a domain and you are running the tool as a domain administrator.

The tool is written in batch/bat and can be easly modifyed if needed.
